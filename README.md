# VR-Games

This repository exists to showcase my progress building VR games. It serves as a running log of experiments, iterations, and improvements as I learn and implement core gameplay systems.

### What you’ll find here
- Work-in-progress game builds and prototypes
- New features as they’re developed (mechanics, UI, levels, etc.)
- Refactors and fixes as the project evolves

### Status
Active development — expect frequent changes and unfinished content.

### Notes
This is primarily a personal progress repository, so things may change quickly or break between commits.
